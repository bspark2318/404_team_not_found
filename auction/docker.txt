DOCKER COMPOSE

yaml file
  - define microservices by name.
    - image: image name and tag
    - contianer_name: custom container name
    - hostname: custom server name
    - entrypoint: /bin/bash
    - tty: true
    - stdin_open: true
    - environment: path variable
    - links: -server will setup a host file to include a reference to a server

DOCKER BUILD


Database will not be inside the container with the microservice. You map out to an external data store
use \ to link together lines of a run command

If you hang an image with run.sh you can copy a new run.sh into the hung image and run it

Create a dockerfile with commands 
docker build . ----> finds the dockerfile in the working directory and builds the image from it
